# Zig Vulkan Example

An (admittedly questionably) example of how to integrate Vulkan, GLFW, and Zig together.

## TODO
- use the GLFW library source instead of a buhch of precompiled binaries
- support every platform that GLFW does (will be easier once the precompiled binaries are gone)
- generate vk.zig programatically
