# Zig Vulkan Example

A questionable example of how to integrate Vulkan, GLFW, and Zig together.

## TODO
- Actually have something worth showing (instead of just printing a bunch of extension info into the console)
- use the GLFW library source instead of a bunch of precompiled binaries
- support every platform that GLFW does (will be easier once the precompiled binaries are gone)
- generate vk.zig programatically
- document everything in an easily understandable way
